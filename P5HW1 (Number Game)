Main()


## Ask the user if the user would like to play the number game.

## Create a function called numberGame to use as the game.

## Create variable guesses to track the number of attempts
## for the user to guess the amount and set equal to 2.

## Generate the random number using the number generator.

## Ask the user to guess the number and return whether it is too high,
## low, or correct using if else statements.

## Put the numberGame function inside a while loop so that it runs
## until the user guesses correctly.

## Display the number of guesses whenver the user guesses correctly and
## give the option to play again using the playAgain variable.
