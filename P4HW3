# This program will take a series of positive numbers and 
# display their sum.

Main()

## Ask the user for a number to begin to find the sum.

## Assign the sum value to the same value as the first number
## to give sum a value.

## Deassign sum value as same value as number so as not
## to automatically double the first number.

## Use a while loop to say while number is greater than
## negative 1 to ask for a new number to add to sum.

## Prompt the user for a new value for integer number.

## Use the while loop to continue to test for the value
## of number so as long as it is greater than -1 it keeps
## adding the new integer to sum.

## Once exiting the loop after the user enters a negative number
## display the final total.
